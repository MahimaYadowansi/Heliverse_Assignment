# Automation Testing Suite

This repository contains an automation testing project built with **Selenium WebDriver** and **Java**, designed to test various functionalities of an e-commerce platform. The suite includes test cases that cover adding items to the cart, UI testing, and form validation. The tests are executed using **TestNG**, with reports generated in the `test-output` folder.

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates the automation of different functionalities of an e-commerce website using Selenium WebDriver and Java. The tests are created to ensure that key features work as expected, such as:

- **Adding an Item to the Cart**: Automates the process of searching for an item, selecting a product, and adding it to the shopping cart.
- **UI Testing**: Verifies that the graphical elements (buttons, text fields, and other UI components) are correctly rendered and interactable.
- **Form Validation Testing**: Automates the validation of form fields, ensuring input validation (like first name, last name,email,phone number etc.) works as expected.
- **Login Test**:Automates the login process using valid credentials and verifies successful login.

## Key Features

- **Cross-browser testing**: Tests can be configured to run across multiple browsers.
- **TestNG for Test Management**: TestNG is used for managing and running the test cases, and generating detailed reports in the `test-output` folder.
- **Reports**: After test execution, reports are automatically generated by TestNG. These reports include detailed information about passed and failed test cases.
- **Selenium WebDriver**: The Selenium WebDriver interacts with the browser to perform the automated actions.

## Technologies and Tools Used

- **Programming Language**: Java
- **Automation Framework**: Selenium WebDriver
- **Test Management**: TestNG
- **Development Environment**: Eclipse IDE
- **Operating System**: Windows 11
